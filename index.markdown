Welcome to our project website! Below you'll find details about our **Stellar Beats** music app and our development
journey.

## 1. Overview of the Project

Stellar Beats is a music application that allows users to listen to music anytime and anywhere. The project was
developed for a class, and we used Jekyll to showcase the development process, key features, and what we learned along
the way.

## 6. Postmortem of Development Experience

### How did the project change
- In iteration 0 we completed the initial vision and features that we wanted to implement for our app. After completing iteration 3, the vision for our app has not changed. The project development did change during iteration 2, where one user story was not completed and was moved to iteration 3. However, it was completed in iteration 3 as planned.



### What did you learn about team or large project development?
-  One of the things we learned about large project development was frequent communication was very important, it helped maintain camaraderie and ensure we had a steady workflow. For future large projects we will start doing more pair programming, that way teammates are able to accelerate task completion. We will continue to communicate well and plan strategically throughout project development. To prevent possible regression in project development we will stop individual work on a specific layer of implementation. That way each group member has some knowledge on more than one layer and can lead to better interoperability across layers. 

### Can you draw any conclusions from what youâ€™ve done?

- Some conclusions we made after completing our project were that creating an app was simpler and more doable than we had previously thought, and that there are certain portions of app development that could have been completed more efficiently. To complete things more efficiently it is important to make plans for a project in the beginning and to make sure that as development progresses that plans are modified accordingly. To ensure that the project stays on track, it is essential to plan effectively, adapt to challenges, and continuously refine development strategies for greater efficiency and success.

### Improvements after iteration 2
 - Our iteration 2 retrospective mentioned that we were having issues completing all tasks on time. We made the decision to start early and have set achievable deadlines for completing each task. During iteration 3 we made sure to plan things thoroughly, setting deadlines and properly communicating any issues a member had, that way it could be rectified in a timely manner.
